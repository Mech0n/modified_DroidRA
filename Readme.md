I just change two things:

- change the ICFG for COAL using Flowdroid.
- Because of the previous step, the DummyMain generation is not needed, I delete it.

### TODO

- Find which Reflection api can not be restored and why.
- Fix bug in BOM (I changed some code just want to run the code after upgrading the soot version. )
